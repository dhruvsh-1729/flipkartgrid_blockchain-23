<h1>Healthcare Report Management (HRM) Project</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Healthcare Report Management (HRM) project focuses on providing a secure platform for managing patient and doctor information by leveraging the Tezos blockchain and advanced encryption techniques.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Utilizes the Tezos blockchain to securely store patient, doctor, and hospital information.</li>
    <li>Ensures information privacy by offering public visibility to stored data through encryption.</li>
    <li>Employs AES encryption to safeguard individual pieces of sensitive information, guaranteeing data confidentiality.</li>
    <li>Generates unique public/private key pairs for patients and doctors, enabling secure communication.</li>
    <li>Enhances data control by sharing AES keys securely encrypted using the RSA algorithm, allowing controlled access.</li>
    <li>Utilizes IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store diagnosis documents, and the hash of the documents is encrypted within the diagnosis information.</li>
    <li>Offers a robust backend for comprehensive identity management, including key verification and efficient message encryption/decryption services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>To set up and run the project:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory where package.json exists.
    Run command : <code>npm install && cd backend/ && npm install && cd ..</code></li>
    <li>Execute the main code using the command: <code>npm run dev</code></li>
    <li>For starting the backend, use the command: <code>npm start</code></li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>Upon launching the project, follow these essential steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Access the project's web interface or APIs to seamlessly interact with the blockchain and effectively manage stored information.</li>
    <li>Ensure secure authentication using your personalized public/private key pair.</li>
    <li>Encrypt and securely store patient, doctor, and hospital information onto the Tezos blockchain.</li>
    <li>Enhance data privacy with AES encryption, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data.</li>
    <li>Control information sharing by securely transmitting encrypted AES keys using the robust RSA algorithm, ensuring limited access.</li>
    <li>Leverage IPFS to securely store diagnosis documents while linking their hash to the encrypted diagnosis information.</li>
    <li>Harness the backend's comprehensive identity management capabilities, including secure key verification and efficient encryption/decryption services.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Additional Highlights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each user is assigned a unique public-private key pair for robust identity and data security.</li>
    <li>Users have the capability to upload their encrypted medical diagnoses onto the blockchain.</li>
    <li>Data sharing is selective, with users maintaining control over whom they share their information with.</li>
    <li>Secure key exchange mechanisms ensure that the AES key used for encryption remains confidential.</li>
    <li>Recipient doctors can access shared data by decrypting the encrypted AES key.</li>
    <li>Recipient doctors can also contribute by uploading encrypted document URLs.</li>
    <li>Users have full authority to retract shared information, offering complete data control.</li>
  </ul>
